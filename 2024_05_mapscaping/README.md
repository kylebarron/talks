GeoParquet for beginners

May 23, 2024

> Cloud-native geospatial, range requests, chucks, COGs and COPCs … [ insert confusing acronym here ]
>
> Sometimes It feels like we need to learn a whole new vocabulary and if you have been doing #geo for a while you might be wondering how much of this is actually going to impact me. What bits of this are the ones that I need to know about?
>
> I don’t think that anyone is going to be talking about cloud native in 10 years, in the same way, no one talks about digital cartography or computer analysis because where else would you do your cartography? And how else would you do your analysis?
>
> Maybe the names won’t be as important but the concepts will and while this episode is focused on Geoparquet it does so within the context of cloud-native geospatial – and this concept is not going away!
